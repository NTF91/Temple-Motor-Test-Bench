# Temple-Motor-Test-Bench
Repository for code and documents for the Temple Motor Test Bench.
A Matlab application that determines efficiency of a motor and propeller 
combination using data supplied by a propeller manufacturer. 
The application will use known test data acquired by APC Propellers and have BLDC motor parameters as an input. 
The resulting application will output the maximum efficiency given the selected propeller and motor parameters.
